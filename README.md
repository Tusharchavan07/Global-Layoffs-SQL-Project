Introduction
In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of global layoffs. The goal was to transform raw data into a clean and structured format, followed by uncovering insights and trends in the layoffs data.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

Company: Name of the company
Layoffs: Number of employees laid off
Layoff Date: Date of the layoffs
Location: Location of the company
Industry: Industry sector of the company
Fund Raised: Amount of funds raised by the company
Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved the following steps:

Removing Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy.
Removing Unwanted Rows and Columns: Excluded irrelevant data to focus on the essential information.
Formatting Data: Standardized date formats and ensured consistency in text data.
Exploratory Data Analysis
During the EDA phase, I analyzed the cleaned data to identify patterns and trends. Key analyses included:

Layoffs by Date: Analyzing the trend of layoffs over time.
Layoffs by Location: Identifying regions with the highest number of layoffs.
Industry Impact: Examining which industries were most affected.
Funding vs. Layoffs: Exploring the relationship between funds raised and the number of layoffs.
Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the trends and factors associated with global layoffs. Key findings include:

A significant increase in layoffs during certain periods.
Specific regions and industries being more affected by layoffs.
A possible correlation between the amount of funds raised and layoffs.
Future Work
Future improvements and extensions of this project may include:

Incorporating additional datasets to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
Using advanced statistical methods and machine learning for predictive analysis.
Creating interactive visualizations using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
